Tic Tac Toe
=
A single player Tic Tac Toe game written in Java (for now, hoping to write in Haskell at a later date), where the computer is your opponent. Download the [.jar](https://github.com/dummycode/TicTacToe/raw/develop/Java/out/TicTacToe.jar) and run using `java -jar TicTacToe.jar`.
### 3 Different Modes
#### Easy
The computer selects a random move, winning when possible.

#### Medium
The computer selects the move it would make on hard 75% of the time and the other 25% of the time it selects the move it would make on easy.

#### Hard
The computer selects the best possible move using a [minimax algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax). I will anyone **$100** if they beat the computer on hard mode, as it is impossible (please code, don't betray me). The best you can do is draw.
